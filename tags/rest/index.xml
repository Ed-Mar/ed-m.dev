Okay I&amp;rsquo;ve been do throwing this idea around in my head after getting that reader to work last week. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need a Kafka just to use cross service just to send REST request between services.</description></item><item><title>220713</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220713/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 15:29:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220713/</guid><description>220713 Wtf is the key used for in Kafka I saw the key inside of the go-kafka for the writer and wasn&amp;rsquo;t wtf it was meant for. TIL I think it to tell kafka what partition to use.</description></item><item><title>220712</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220712/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 20:31:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220712/</guid><description>220712 0251 So this is what I came up with I am positive this will change once the integration is more along, but I need to start from some where.

I just finished the PUT It works, but took some messing about with.</description></item><item><title>211223</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/211223/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 04:10:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/211223/</guid><description>211223 Kinda lost with the channel addition So In my head its straight forward, cause adding the channel obj to the Server is straight forward but integrating with the existing middleware, and mux is throwing me for a loop.</description></item></channel></rss>
