I have been looking into how best how to handle the Nextjs front end with the backend services. Which is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about until I start writing application code cause the token to the frontend with no issue but using that token to with real concern, but how to best hand off that login ed in user to the backend came with some issues(more vagueness).</description></item><item><title>211206</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/211206/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 16:59:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/211206/</guid><description>211106 Clients so planning out the objects/clients etc&amp;hellip;
I am going with conduit for the app name for now so from my current understanding I am going to need one for the backend(data)(conduit-backend) not super positive on this on if I use a object relation mapper but just in case i think it mite be redundant one for the browser app(conduit-browser) one for the server side interactions api calls (conduit-server-side) Groups At least to start i am just going to have these groups I am going to lean on keycloak to handle what user have access to what servers(discord term) for now I am not postive this best way, but speed is the name of the game right now I need to get some Proof of Concept completed sooner than later.</description></item></channel></rss>
