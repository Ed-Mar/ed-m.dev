The more I do it the more fun it is&amp;hellip;
Just realized I am going to need to rework this saga again For the Execute interface for the transaction command I made each of the sub interfaces(classes in my head) take in an interface so you can pass anything to the sub Transactions Commands.</description></item><item><title>220726</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220726/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 20:22:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220726/</guid><description>220726 Okay I&amp;rsquo;ve been working the saga pattern. It took me a while of paper and thinking to figure it out. I have the concept worked out. Looking at it now it seems simple, but it took me a lot of big thinking to figure it out.</description></item><item><title>220712</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220712/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 20:31:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220712/</guid><description>220712 0251 So this is what I came up with I am positive this will change once the integration is more along, but I need to start from some where.

I had some code written for a saga, Its not perfect, but I would like to start to mess with it.
package saga import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;io&amp;#34; &amp;#34;net/http&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34;) type Saga struct { SageName string Transactions []*transaction } type transaction struct { TransactionName string ServiceName string TransactionAction } func (t *transaction) GetTransaction() *transaction { return t } //TODO find a better name for this.</description></item><item><title>220108</title><link>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220108/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 17:30:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://ed-m.dev/notes/projects/conduit/220108/</guid><description>210108 ~ 210122 Had wood to cut and snow to clear, plus trying to dev on generator power and LTE got old.
