# 220927 
## Layouts are only for top lvl. 
*_0550*

So while trying to make a layout for list pages /notes/projects/*. I came to the understanding that I can't using Hugo normal variables/function to do this. Which is fun. 

I have been seeing inking lings of this going through all the documentation, forum post, book I found, and various websites. 

Here is the link to the forum post that informed me of this

[Link to Forum Post](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/list-pages-of-sub-sub-folders/9436/6?)

>"You cannot currently have a specific layout for the nested sections (only the top level). **There may be workarounds** for you, but I donâ€™t understand what you want to do good enough." ~ [bep](https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/bep)

Granted this was posted back in 2017, but from my probing and testing it's still rings true. 

## *"**There may be workarounds**"*

Alright so there is some hope if I want to keep my organization of my files to make sense(to me at-least).

So later on in the same forum post there is one proposed solution. [Link to Post in thread](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/list-pages-of-sub-sub-folders/9436/11?)

The proposed solution is to just to have the layout itself figure out what page its on and then populate it with the desired layout. 

Now I must ask my self that all import question. "If so? How to?"

Messing around trying to figure out how to make this work I found that *{{.Section}}* & {{.CurrentSection}} give to separate things. I was under the impression they would do the same thing when run a sub-directory of the section, because the section is defined by the top level folder in /content. But nope. 

```html
{{if  .Section}}
	Section: {{.Section}}
	<br/>
	Current Section: {{.CurrentSection}}
	<br/>
{{end}}
```
>**Output**: Run in "http://localhost:1313/notes/projects/conduit/"
>
>Section: notes  
>Current Section: Page(/notes/projects/conduit/_index.md)

[Link to HUGO Section Documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/#section-page-variables-and-methods)

It states that .CurrentSection can return a page if it is a section... Which it does. 

So Hugo says that my branch bundles are sections, but not what you get when you use {{.Section}}. I assume that my mis-understanding was from the concentrate from the lexicon, them wanting to make hugo easy to implement for less complex site creation, maybe some backwards compatibility, and some me being a fucking idiot. 

Well why was any of this fucking relevant to substituting layout content depending on location. Cause it allows me to use the **.{{.IsDescendant $anotherPage))**  which under the section documentation. 

Granted there is a few other ways to go about this just get the abs path and token it, add a param in each of the sub index, or whatever that 2D arrays of sections from the forum post did. 

The is Descendant makes the logic for this easy
```
{{if  .Section}}
	Current Page Path:{{.RelPermalink}}
	<br>
	Is this a Descendant of "{{$anotherPage}}": {{.IsDescendant  $anotherPage}}
{{end}}
```
Output:

 So now its breaking down notes layout and making one for the for project pages.
