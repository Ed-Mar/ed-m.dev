# 220921
## Update on hugo notes site
*_0348*

So the Progress has been coming along, over the last week. (https://ed-m.dev)
### Work Progress
Been learning and getting better and Hugo implementation and css/frontend. 
- Got basic tags working
- Summary on the homepage(mite need to tune this some more)
- Added a subtitle Front matter parms to singles and partial to combine them 
- and probably some more things I forgot about.

### outstanding Issues encounter
I am stuck on a few things right now. 

I can't seem to get my preferred date format(YYMMDD_HHMM) to work cause I can't call int Month on the time function in go with in Hugo. This was a like 6 days ago, and I have know more about working with Hugo functions/variables

Local fonts are not working idk about that I assume Its just not getting and is simple

One I would like to change in the md->html rendering, but can't seem to find really how to do it. So let me see if can explain each block of text(so like a "words words /n /n"  ) in the markdown file is rendered into a p html tag. I would prefer these be a div instead cause there tends be a better break between each of them. I'm sure there should be a work around for this in css, but I can't figure it out; and I'm far from being an css expert, just enough to be dangerous.

I tired to take the {{.Content}} and replace it each of the each of the p tags and just add an br/ tag to the end of it. It did what I wanted, but when it piped to the page its in quotes which means it doesn't render into HTML. See screenshots below. 

**Note instead of trying to insert a div or some other tag just increase the margin on the p tags. Edit: 221004_1254**

### What's next. 
- I am not a fan of how the singles pages looks. Want to work on readability and it just doesn't feel right. Granted I kinda have the feeling for the most of the site, but the singles are the highest on that list. 
- Get the code highlighting for with the renderhook to not look shit. 
- Re organize the CSS. A lot of it is stepping on other classes styles and so on
	- If can get break it down in separate files for better organization 
- Get the local fonts to work I was looking at the time to DL the font in the chromium dev tools and it was like 75% of the load time. Granted still small but why not and limit dependencies. 
- Do the notes & projects _index.md and layouts. 


Then once I am complete with every and mostly happy with the site 
- Move all the notes on my local machine over
	- add all the necessary front matter and think hard over the tags good and hard maybe create a file in Data to keep info and better. 
- Make it easy for me create my notes with some .profile for bash/zsh edits to add some shortcuts 
- Learn more about robot.txt and < meta > to see if can get the site out and maybe have some else beside me read these, but either way
- Figure out how I make so ppl can email me while fighting the bots from spamming
- Get it on the Web for as cheap as possible

I am sure I'll find some more items as they come to me.
