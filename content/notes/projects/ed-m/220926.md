# 220926

## Current Progression

*_0824*
So I think I am in a good state with the Notes/Projects.

### Short Term - TODO List

- Updates single page code syntax
	- So Hugo seems to know when there is code in the markdown file and does some formatting and styling with it, but I want to improve it. 
- I keep going back and forth between if i should put a footer on pages. I think I am leaning more towards yes just a simple understated one. 
- Layout for individual projects. I don't I will have to create to much I have lot of I can pull from on the notes/projects 
- The styling on list on single pages needs some love

- CSS still needs to re-organized I noticed a lot of single use css and repeat things that could be better captured with better class organization and tweaks 
	- I have been trying to do this as I go, but its still shit in opinion(probably always be tho) 
- About layout still needs to be created. 
- Tags page layout needs to be created. 

That should be enough to keep my busy this week.  

## Code in markdown

*_0931*

Alright that ended up being rather easy to change what I want. Its more fleshed out and easy to implement

Just had to change the config to change the style and changed the default code guess to true just in case I forget to add it in the markdown.

```yaml
markup:
  guessSyntax: true
  style: native
```


*_0955* -> Footer Complete
