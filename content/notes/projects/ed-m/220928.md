# 220928

## Current Progress

The *"**{{.IsDescendant $anotherPage}}**"* is still working from yesterday to change the layout for depending of depth dir in notes. 

## Getting all tags for a given project and counting the occurrences

*_1001*

I would like get all the tags for a given project and then have a number for how many times they appeared to do things. I am not positive yet if just going to be a weight thing or just throw the number next to it. then if you click on it do something.  

### Attempt 1 

So I tired to have a slice of dictators with the key word being the term it self and value being how many times it has occurred. Well that was the plan anyway, but when I tired to use the **in**  keyword in hugo to try and search the slice for the maps key it doesn't work that nice 

```html
<!-- Note this does not work --> 
<div  class="project all-tags container">
	{{$sliceName := slice}}
	{{$d1 := dict  "tagName1"  4}}
	{{$d2 := dict  "tagName2"  2}}
	{{$d3 := dict  "tagName3"  7}}
	{{$sliceName = append  $d1  $sliceName}}
	{{$sliceName = append  $d2  $sliceName}}
	{{$sliceName = append  $d3  $sliceName}}
	<div>Output of Slice Name: {{$sliceName}}</div>
	{{if  in  $sliceName  "tagName1"}}
		| true |
	{{else}}
	| false |
	{{end}}
</div>
```

>Output: 
>Output of Slice Name: [map[tagName1:4] map[tagName2:2] map[tagName3:7]]
>| false |


I am going to play with this for a while to see if can get something similar to work. 


### Attempt 1.1

Try with Scratch

Gotta play with this a little 

Does the NewScratch Overwrite maps with same key or throw an error?
```
{{$data:= newScratch}}
{{$data.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "tagName1"  5  }}
{{$data.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "tagName1"  7  }}
{{$data}}
```
Output: >{map[projectTags:map[tagName1:7]] {{0 0} 0 0 0 0}}

It overwrites 

~~Just found out that Hugo does not have a get via key function. So it looks like I will have to create my own~~

> Go and hug your normal programming language 

Nevermind it kind does have a Get function for slices and maps. It's call index (for some reason...)  

### Attempt 2 

*_1057*

```
{{$data:= newScratch}}

{{$data.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "tagName1"  5  }}

{{$data.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "tagName1"  7  }}

{{$data.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "tagName2"  69  }}

{{$data.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "tagName3"  420  }}

{{$temp := $data.Get  "projectTags"}}

Collection of maps:s{{$temp}}<br/>

Whats at "tagName1" : {{index  $temp  "tagName1"}}<br/>

Whats at "tagName666" : {{index  $temp  "tagName666"}}<br/>

{{if (index  $temp  "tagName1") }}

The Check for key "tagName1" has found something: {{index  $temp  "tagName1"}}<br/>

{{else}}

The Check for key "tagName1" has found NOTHING <br/>

{{end}}

{{if (index  $temp  "tagName666") }}

The Check for key "tagName666" has found something<br/>

{{else}}

The Check for key "tagName666" has found Nothing {{index  $temp  "tagName666"}}<br/>

{{end}}
```

>Output:
>Collection of maps:smap[tagName1:7 tagName2:69 tagName3:420]  
Whats at "tagName1" : 7  
Whats at "tagName666" :  
The Check for key "tagName1" has found something: 7  
The Check for key "tagName666" has found Nothing

Alright will this experimentation complete I think have all the necessary understanding to do this in combination with my tag work prior to this. 

#### Complete Base Logic Complete

*_1242*

```html
{{with  .Param  "projectName"  }}

<!-- Set the Current Project Name that we will looking for it's Pages-->

{{$projectname := .}}

<!-- Intilize a newScratch to hold the collections of maps of tags them self and number of times they appear in the project's notes -->

{{$projectTagsCollection:= newScratch}}

<!--These 2 need to be Intilized and set or you'll get some nil errors-->

{{$projectTagsCollection.SetInMap  "projectTags"  "DELETE-ME"  "Once Done - Use me and throw me away"  }}

{{$tempMap := dict  "Just-Need-To-Initialize-This"  666  }}

  

<!-- Loop over each of the Pages matching the given projectname -->

{{range  where site.Pages  "Params.project"  $projectname}}

<!-- Loop over each of the tags for a given Page -->

{{  range  .Params.tags  }}

<!--Set tempMap to the "projectTags" from inside projectTagsCollection-->

{{$tempMap = $projectTagsCollection.Get  "projectTags"}}

<!-- Check to see if Tag is in the collection of maps-->

{{if (index  $tempMap  .)}}

<!-- If the current Tag is already in the Collection of maps Key-->

<!-- We take the value at that tag and add one to it and set it to a temp-->

{{$plusOne := add (index  $tempMap  .) 1}}

<!-- Then the new couter value is overwritten at the current tags key value in the collection of project tags -->

{{$projectTagsCollection.SetInMap  "projectTags"  .  $plusOne}}

{{else}}

<!-- If the current Tag is NOT in the Collection of maps Key-->

<!-- Then we add to the collection with value of 1 -->

{{$projectTagsCollection.SetInMap  "projectTags"  .  1}}

<!-- I want to limit the exposer place holder DeleteMe so I delete it as soon as there is another key inserted -->

<!-- Yes I am aware that its a waste to keep this here for every new tag-->
{{$projectTagsCollection.DeleteInMap  "projectTags"  "DELETE-ME"}}



{{end}} <!--end of if -->

{{end}}<!-- end of range of tags -->

{{end}}<!-- end of pages that make project name -->

  

{{$projectTagsCollection.Get  "projectTags"}}

{{end}}
```

Output: 
map[bitnami:1 devblog:2 ingress:1 keycloak:2 kubernetes:1 local-dns:1 minikube:1 postgres:1]

With my current number of post/notes these tags do indeed add up.

Alright I am done with that side quest
