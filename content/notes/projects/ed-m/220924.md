 ### Progress of the Notes/Projects Page

![Updates](https://i.imgur.com/2soc5dN.png)

I have all the data being pull and organized in way I want right now. I have the Projects being pulled and with its three panels(git and basic info, Project note Stats, and the 3 latest post) for all projects and there notes. Then at the bottom of the page I have the non project notes being listed. Right now those do not have a limit as I do not think I will be making them(at least publicly). 

So now I will do my best and try this look less like shit with some CSS. I mite try and better organize the CSS I have as well
