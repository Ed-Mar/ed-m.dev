# 211223

## Kinda lost with the channel addition
So In my head its straight forward, cause adding the channel obj to the Server is straight forward but integrating with the existing middleware, and mux is throwing me for a loop.

### Native Postman runs like Sh*t

## Note on timeline

I am running short on time for this, because at a minimum I have the following things to complete to meet the MVP. Be Straight up I am not going to be able to finish the MVP with amount of time I have left. I will try for the first two just to see a message on the frontend. 
 
- **Messaging CRUD**
- **Frontend in some short of form** 
- Containerization 
- OIDC from the keycloak
