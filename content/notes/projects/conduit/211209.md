# 211209
##  I will do the oidc integration with the code later
For now I am starting on the code for the the application now. I have started with some basic apis and middle ware for the server data type. Just gonna start basic stuff and I will build outward. I am going to integrate the keycloak SSO later. I am having trouble getting it work due to lack of understanding on my part( I have already lost like three days on that, I just need to move forward)

By the time you read this should be on github for this([Github Link](https://github.com/Ed-Mar/appalachian-bastion)). 
 > Note: I did remove the infra yaml from the hub for now. I put it back later once I have the sites project structure more thought out. I know I do want everything in one repo

## Short term Action items 

### Services
 - [ ] Get J SON validation integrated 
 - [ ] Get Channels data structure complete
	 - [ ] Get Channels Service Completed 
 - [ ] Get Message data structure complete
	 - [ ] Get Message service Completed 
### Frontend
- [ ] Flesh out the UI I made the other day in NextJS with bare minimum servers,channels, and message items (just need to display what server/channel you are in plus the associated messages)  
- [ ] Connect the frontend and backend and wiggle them together for now
### Containerization 
- [ ] Containerize the services 
	- [ ] Server
	- [ ] Channels
	- [ ] Messages
- [ ] Containerize Next JS frontend
- [ ] Thrown them on the cluster
	- [ ] Add them to the ha proxy
	- [ ] Check the freaking DNS 

## Longer Term Action Items
- [ ] Open API ( Swagger documentation) 
	> I think i mite do this sooner than later I think It would help me with doing validation plus code gen for the client for the frontend
	
- [ ] Integrate oidc  (some how)
- [ ] Add a database (currently using in code data store)
