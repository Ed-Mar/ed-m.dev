## Postal SMTP

Okay after spending some time looking around at the state of the postal. I have found a few items.

- [Postal Github](https://github.com/postalserver/postal) and it creators and maintainer are making updates and so on, and are focused on containerization.
	- They don't have a public docker hub from what I can tell, which is odd but I see why so you have to host the image your self if you want use stock version.
- There is a helm version of this that is of this that was created  about 2ish years ago by a [Linkyard](https://github.com/linkyard/postal-kubernetes) with consideration to cert-manger and ingress options which is good. 
	- There is an issue tho with it being 2ish years old the kube api objects are out of date(apiVersion: apps/v1beta1) which can updated.

	-  Also I am not positive but looks like readiness probes wern't a thing at that time so initcontainers busybox containers are used to wait for the two required backend to be spun up. There also a few other things if left in would bother me so if I do end up going with would require a good amount of changes
- There also seems to be another option to get this working and its a customized docker version of postal with some spam and anti virius running on  alpine instead of using the given Ubuntu. [Github tiredofit/docker-postal](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-postal)
	- Its in docker and on the hub which is nice save me some time plus it comes with some addon option out the box
	- So let [Kompose](https://kompose.io/)  it ![oof that a lot lol](https://i.imgur.com/yOkkz7b.png)
	- yeah that's is good amount of kube objects and also the those  pvc are all in different volumes which i guess would work, but that seems wrong. I had to look into this while writing this,(5 mins later). It seems you can do both so hmm

## So what the plan for SMTP 
  ~~I am going to use both [linkyard/postal-kubernetes](https://github.com/linkyard/postal-kubernetes) & [tiredofit/docker-postal](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-postal) I am going to mash them together into something that can work on kube.  They will just plan kube yaml for no helm. Once I get to a place with all these object I may consider making it into working helm but maybe
I have started on this I got the all the env variables  files in config Mappings and respective secrets in to separate files (50+)~~

~~There is still a good amount of work to do on converting this into something that works well.~~

## Edit
I will not be doing this Postal is kinda of mess. 
The [tiredofit/docker-postal](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-postal) uses his own custom alpine image which is eh, but I tired to remove the s6 thing in that wont stop the container even it fails from what I can tell and even it do build its hug for alpine idk

- They don't have a dockerhub 
	- so you have to build your image. fine
		- but that image will failed then I check the git hub issue board 40+ open issue. I do think i could messaround it get it work with the base image, but have spent about a day on this. SOoooooo
