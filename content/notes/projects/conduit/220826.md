This bitnami keycloak chart got hands for real. fighting with the lack of proper documentation is fucking wild. There is a lot of of it and yet somehow all it seems to be useless to me or just not work. I do not blame them it is popular and thus must it work, so I must blame my lack of understanding of how to operate it. I went back to see how I did this the first time coming on all most a year from now, but my notes really don't tell me what whether I used a chart or just smashed some yaml together linking the necessary parts together. I have spent a week plus on trying to get this chart to work I have made progress and stop getting errors which is nice, but now I don't errors it just doesn't work as expected.
