# 33MB of yaml later 
Okay I have gave up on due this with just kube, and getting some help with from Helm. 

I am switching from linode domains handling to cloudflare cause I can't get the [DNS01](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/) to work correctly with the web hook function of cert-manager. There is this [Linode Community Post](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/21032/how-do-i-use-dns01-solver-using-linode-dns-on-cert-manager) from sub one year. Two personal from that post give two chart [Git One](https://github.com/slicen/cert-manager-webhook-linode)  [Git Two](https://github.com/monostream/cert-manager-linode) that try and deal with this. I can't get them to work for some reason or another(I assume I don't wtf am doing the more I work on this).  Cloudflare is a supported DNS01 provider of [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). That transfer is in progress now so i just have that working when that is done.

[85%] helm keycloak/postgres 
[55%] ingress with tls 
[-20%] actual development 
## Some Finds along the way
- [Lens](https://github.com/lensapp/lens) a k8 "ide" it just a kube dashboad with some nice options, but I have run into an issue with custom definitions
	- I am still getting this issue https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues/3903 so I can't see the cert-manager custom item in the list so 
- [Oliver Coding Blog](https://www.olivercoding.com/2021-01-02-kubernetes-home/) so found this blog post that outlines at lot of what I am trying to do for the most part
	- ***Note**: the keycloak chart values are little out of date. I will push mine once I get them closer finalized* 

## Thoughts
should have some more time to work on this as this month winds down due to things. 

For some reason I really don't enjoy Helm, Id rather just work with k8 yaml no charts. I know I properly wrong, but just find helm annoying for some reason. 

also might try haproxy
