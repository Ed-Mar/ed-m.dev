## Clients

so planning out the objects/clients etc... 
 - I am going with conduit for the app name for now
 - so from my current understanding I am going to need 
 	 - one for the backend(data)(conduit-backend)
		 - not super positive on this on if I use a object relation mapper but just in case i think it mite be redundant 
	 - one for the browser app(conduit-browser)
	 - one for the server side interactions api calls (conduit-server-side)

## Groups
![setting up default for users](https://i.imgur.com/l5tmGk0.png)
At least to start i am just going to have these groups
I am going to lean on keycloak to handle what user have access to what servers(discord term) for now I am not postive this best way, but speed is the name of the game right now I need to get some Proof of Concept completed sooner than later.

## Users

Just some basic test users with assigned happy path roles

> its noon 30. work to cont.

##  Openid Connect Framework
Okay the book and from last post did have some example code for using ***go-oidc*** but it did not have [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)  which seems very important. so i need to find one that does.

There seems to be two options that le google throws back 
-  [odic](https://github.com/caos/oidc)
- [fosite](https://github.com/ory/fosite)

they both seem to be good options fosite seems to be bit bigger and is not based of the vanilla go lang package *so I will be going with odic*.
