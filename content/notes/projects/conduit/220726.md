# 220726

Okay I've been working the saga pattern. It took me a while of paper and thinking to figure it out. I have the concept worked out. Looking at it now it seems simple, but it took me a lot of big thinking to figure it out. 

I stuck now how to cast an interface{} into its appropriate variable type. I have an to allow a standardize of the *Execute* (*code snippet bellow*)  function cause I want to use the TransactionCommand as a collection. I know I could easy just make easier on myself to just have custom Transaction commands in each of the Transaction themselves, but I want to repeatable pattern to allow for REST or Kafka, and anymore Command message functions I mite need/want to use in the future. The idea that I really don't need the Saga pattern at the projects current point is not lost on me. I have also argued with myself if the channel service and server service should be separated at this point.   
```go
type TransactionCommand interface {  
   Execute(i interface{}) (response string, err error)  
}
```

Another item that come to my mind is that if you send a kafka event message. There is no response like REST. Which I knew I and I have worked with in the past, but really tired to do the saga pattern with. So hear me out if you use the saga pattern using a message broker you end needing one permanent listener/reader then another temporary one every time a service tries to Execute a Saga. Cause that permanent one doesn't have a straight line of sight into the on going function call running the Saga itself. So you you need to open the temporary listener with a unique key in the running Saga if you want a response from any other service you gonna need that temporary listener. I grabbed the example diagram from the  [microservices website](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html). Is this really big deal not really you can still use the same docker/kube instance of Kafka you already have, but it just seems like a lot compute to use for something that could happen many times a second.

##  Execute(i interface{})...

Okay after overthinking it for about 3 hours I got it go into a http.Request. I tried a few other things before I got here like JSON marshaling and unmarshaling(if you try this you will get a JSON end of line/file not found) and other option I *almost* did was looping threw the values and just copy/pasting them in which seemed really dumb but I was prepared if I could not think if somthing selse
**Casting was the solution** granted I didn't think I could do this with non primitives 

```go
	httprequest, ok := i.(http.Request)
	if !ok {
		log.Fatal("could not assert value to http.Request")
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(httprequest), httprequest)
```
>**Output:** http.Request {GET http://localhost:9292/servers  0 0 map[] <nil> <nil> 0 [] false  map[] map[] <nil> map[]   <nil> <nil> <nil> <nil>}
