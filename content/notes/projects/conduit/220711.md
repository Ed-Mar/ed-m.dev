# 220711

Working on the kafka integration gotta find a better way to user the viper env loader package, cause I am running to problems sending the broker and env information around to different so I think I need to work on this cause I am getting this error(below) I am I have gotten it similar when bring on the other services two cause I try to not repeat code. Not a big issue, but just needs to be address.

Okay this was and  easier than I though you can put multiple paths to the viper for the same file name. So this just put the absolute pwd. This is labeled in their docs [Link to Github Readme](https://github.com/spf13/viper#reading-config-files)

Alright I got some ability to Read messages I went with whole another runner for this, I thought about having the reader run on the same runner as the rest service. I decided against this for now and I guess I could integrate them if later if needed to make it easier to development. 

okay thinking about it I need to rethink the have the one service bus cause it seems like the number of partitions will work the why I was thinking so I think every service will get its own consumer group group and topic
