# 220101
## Now What

So I am going to try and break down each of the services that I have created to SQL schemes/Queries with the necessary item so that don't have go into the database for any reason.

So stuff like this:

 Looking at that code you 'll see items that lock me into postgres,([pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) ,  & "information_schema.table") which removes one of the advantages of using pure SQL and that it can be database Agnostic. I may end hating this later, but whatever send it. 

I am trying find a way to not have to maintain both the model for json and the sql schema together in the same struct so when I need to make changes or additions i can in one place, but there doesn't seem to be one that can do that with references to other tables 

Here is [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx), but I still have to maintain the schema separate,

GORM did that, but doesn't seem to a viable option for micro services or at least at my understanding for what I want to do with. 

### Next things

#### Reading another Book
If I am going to do the microservices things I guess I should read their bible things. Cause I think I missing some information on this topic. Going to Cherry pick some chapters that seem relevant to see if any insight can be gained

#### Get some schema together

With this I have exactly what I want, but I also have know what I want so a double edge sword.  

This is not what I going with, but show some things, but is still very wrong

Red: UUID this was easier than I thought to get working, but I will need the extension to be enabled for each database it used in. Just another thing to error check for and implement. 

Blue: Postgres allows for arrays, but after reading up on them they do append when updating they update the whole array which is a waste, so I think going with inter-between table for many-to-many at least. 

Yellow: just being able to do a reference. I think have be able to alter a table with running a query while still using GORM, but doing so makes me just not want to use GORM or any ORM(go-pg did the same thing).

##  #devemeber2021

So I failed, but I will continue to work on this item for some time, but I need to find a new job so that may take of available brain availability 

I will keep going with this. It was always a study first and it lined up with #devemeber2021. Granted I was hoping to get farther than getting to temporary user data model to implement messages and realizing my database interface conflicted with microservices aspirations.
