# 220107

## Out with the GROM in with pgx 

was working and messing around in another project trying to get a better understanding on how I am going to do this saga thing, when I open back this project I forgot that I still have to remove all that grom stuff

So I gotta finish replacing the gorm database Interface with pgx one. 

## DB Users and Databases 
[database per service](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html)

Since the book told me to and I don't know enough to not listen to it all the services need their own databases so I figured they should all have their own user(roles) to interface with to in crease visibility 


### SQL Error handling 
Found [this](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/issues/474) on  for getting useful information from the error code send back from the database. so I can put in some better error handling
