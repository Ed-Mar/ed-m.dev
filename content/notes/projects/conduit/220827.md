# 220827


I have moved to getting keycloak to install via a manual installation( kubectl ). I have finished postgres sql. Its rather straight forward and there is a lot material for about installation via a quick a web search. I mite have to mess with networking of postgres to integrate with keycloak, but I am under the illusion of there are only but so many options that would need to be altered to work with keycloak. 

[Link to yaml via Github](https://github.com/Ed-Mar/appalachian-bastion/tree/keycloak/keycloak/kubectl/postgres) 
 
cli command for smoke testing operational postgres post installation 
```bash
kk exec -it postgres-keycloak-stateful-set-0 -- psql -h localhost -U postgres-base-user --password -p 5432  
keycloak
```
