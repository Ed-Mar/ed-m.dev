# 220728

*_0852*
Lost like 3 hours not cause I was messing up sub typing and design patterns of golang, but cause I did not know how slices work apparently which was fun, cause I was like it can't be slice it has the more complex part of this. My stupidity knows no bound. I rewrote the Transaction relationship twice before I was sure they would work then before I looked at slice.
