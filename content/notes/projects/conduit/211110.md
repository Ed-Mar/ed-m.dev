## SMTP 
I had limited interactions with SMTP really only inputting provided cred to use one that was already set up for some bot related work professionally to integrate with an API 

Now working through all the keycloak features when I see this.

![ah some things I have not thought about until now](https://i.imgur.com/mpZTX5H.png)

But something i did not plan for, and email sever idk why. It would used for users to validate an email. Granted this i not one of the item i have listed as necessary goals, but non the less I will waste only today and try and figure how to add some SMTP to my cluster. 

So I go to looking, and i find some open source ones
I find two that the internet seems to like: [IRedMail](https://github.com/iredmail/dockerized) & [Postal](https://github.com/postalserver/postal)

#### IRedMail 
doesn't seem to be production ready or at least the docker version.

#### Postal

Seems to be more ready for containerization and gives a nod to linode, but when I search on linode for any info on it there isn't any it seems. Regardless I think will try with this seems a lil more ready plus I already have one redhat item going.

I am going to try and get postal up and working
