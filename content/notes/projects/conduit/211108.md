## Progress 211108_1203
- ingress controller is operation(haproxy)
- cert-manger is operational
- keycloak is operational
	- more testing of full functionally is still needed, but initial smoke test everything seems to as it should


 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ed-Mar/appalachian-bastion/): has been updated with helm values and cluster issuers
	

## Next items

- Get a better understanding of the realms and how to best operate keycloak 
- test the email validation for user sign-up
- plan out the structure of the date of what is need for a user sign up. 

### Future item *(In no particular order)*
- get app up working with some go bones
	- deal with the SAML login 
- plan out the data structures for all the items that I think i can deliver before the time is up
- pick a backend (relational or not is the real question)
	- once the data is finalized(-ish) get some swagger going 
- frontend work if they exist so i guess i have to deal with that too
- other(s)

Looks like we're getting out of ***yaml land...***
