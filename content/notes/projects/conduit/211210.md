# 211210

## CRUD operations for Servers 
![broken down handlers](https://i.imgur.com/xJyDBYP.png)

So I have the basic REST crud operations for the for the server service. For the Create, Update, and delete aren't necessary for the MVP, but I thought since i was here and for practice. For the future I will have to the create, delete, and update interface with keycloak to add/remove/update the necessary roles, but that is for a later time I really just need the GET right now and will remove them from the client. 

Client -> Runner -> Mux -> Handler -> Validation -> Server CRUD function

## Open 2.0 (Swagger) Meta +  Docs
So looking at what needed to be done I needed a client for the frontend so I figure I'd do two things at one documentation and get some of that yummy code gen.  so I did that for this primary start.

Swagger docs
```go 
$ server-api/handlers/docs.go

// Package handlers classification of Server API  
//

package handlers  
  
import "server-api/data"  
  
// Generic error message returned as a string  
// swagger:response errorResponse  
type errorResponseWrapper struct {  
   // Description of the error  
 // in: body  Body GenericError
 ...
 ```


![Serve the redocs page and the swagger.yaml](https://i.imgur.com/3X5BQFo.png)
Serve both  the Redocs and the swagger on the base directory 

Don't think I'll keep the yaml on forever but I think it will help with code gen once it gets on the cluster mite make it easier. 

## Next.js Frontend
 Alright I am getting into frontend and straight up out of my element. 

So I followed the Next.js quick-start guide. I have some experience with js but with bots so eh. I followed the guide to get two pages up and still need to table or something for the get call for the table.
