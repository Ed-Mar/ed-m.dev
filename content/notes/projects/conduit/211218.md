Bog standard nothing docker compose

> Note I plan to turn on ssl mode([link](https://blog.crunchydata.com/blog/set-up-tls-for-postgresql-in-kubernetes)) on later when this gets on the cluster
## Using GORM for database 
Documentation for this and the package it self makes this rather easy. It is extra dependency, but for now its find. I like ORMs but I understand why some don't and agree for the most part 
Automigration is complete for the server struct

##  .ENV files and being smooth brain
Took me a few (*cough hours) to get the env files to work ending up using the [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) package. Works rather well. There are some random files that need to be cleaned up from some other packages trial and error, but I will make a push by the time this goes up so if you want take a gander

____
Will cont to work on filling out rest of the CRUD and project files directory layout will be the next items. After those items I will get to start getting to the channels once that
