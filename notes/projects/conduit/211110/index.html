<h2 id=smtp>SMTP</h2>
<p>I had limited interactions with SMTP really only inputting provided cred to use one that was already set up for some bot related work professionally to integrate with an API</p>
<p>Now working through all the keycloak features when I see this.</p>
<p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mpZTX5H.png alt="ah some things I have not thought about until now"></p>
<p>But something i did not plan for, and email sever idk why. It would used for users to validate an email. Granted this i not one of the item i have listed as necessary goals, but non the less I will waste only today and try and figure how to add some SMTP to my cluster.</p>
<p>So I go to looking, and i find some open source ones
I find two that the internet seems to like: <a href=https://github.com/iredmail/dockerized>IRedMail</a> & <a href=https://github.com/postalserver/postal>Postal</a></p>
<h4 id=iredmail>IRedMail</h4>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to be production ready or at least the docker version.

<h4 id=postal>Postal</h4>
<p>Seems to be more ready for containerization and gives a nod to linode, but when I search on linode for any info on it there isn&rsquo;t any it seems. Regardless I think will try with this seems a lil more ready plus I already have one redhat item going.

<p>I am going to try and get postal up and working</p>
