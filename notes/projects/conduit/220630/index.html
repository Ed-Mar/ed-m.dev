<p>Okay while looking through the code for the channels I realized I had not run it since moving everything to a new drive and while also looking at it kinda confused.</p>
<p>So while I did created the DB User for the channel service, I did not do anything else so for future me I am going to write it down, but eh SQL queries I left my self in file were a big help</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the Super user create the Database with the owner set to the new service db user.</li>
<li>Log in to the new db user and connect to that new Database</li>
<li>Add your extension that you need, and confirm they are there</li>
<li>Create the Table with your columns</li>
<li>Last Note: You have been putting the queries in file in database/ folder of each other services use those and keep making them until you have a ci pipeline do for you or at least some automation/script/Dockerfile something do it for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I added a get every channel in to the get handler and model rather straight forward. This was more a way to make sure the service still works. I also never did add the Delete,Update to the model at all. Looking at it I need to rework how the URI server id/channel id works cause I am have confused myself with this seemly simple thing.</p>
<p>I think I am going to tighten up the channel service to at least match the server service before I put all my big brain Saga plans into action.</p>
<p>Personal Notes
I keep catching myself saying there are a lot parts in this thing a few times while working on this. This is new idk why maybe I am just getting old idk just an odd note.</p>
<p>_
Let me commit all this junk I am tiered of being in the branch no good reason.</p>

Working on fleshing out the channel service
noticed I have a lot of repeat code for error handling for sql errors that could be exported it&rsquo;s own package. So getting it down to add to the list of shit that needs to be completed for this.</p>
<p>Also moving to a new branch ate one my env files so that was annoying, but eh.</p>
