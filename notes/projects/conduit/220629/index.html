Okay looking into it I have a better idea of what Kafka is, but has came with some issues I need to have each service have it own message command system thingy. This comes with a lot of extra items</p>
<ul>
<li>Each service is going to need another running main to listen for message sent via Kafka
<ul>
<li>So going to need a whole another running program(main.go) use concurrency to listen for REST and Kafka Messages at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I need to make a schema or pick a command schema to get the services to send and receive commands cause right I am going sending byte arrays that were once strings I think i can use JSON which means I could just send a REST command if pick to make a whole new main to run or just skip and send it right to middle-ware/handlers</li>
<li>Saga orchestrations so I did some work on this, but I needs to make a way to pump these sagas out have them keep track of whats happens.</li>
<li>Do I create one big cross service topic-group or break them down, cause only having one <em>feels</em>like an incorrect way to do,
<ul>
<li><strong>Positives</strong> of having just one big cross-service topic-group
<ul>
<li>could have savings with not having to have separate containers for each listener that service interacts with or having</li>
<li>granted I could run them all one main.go with concurrency depending on traffic and available compute would mean it could slow.</li>
<li>Would not have to create and track the separate list of listeners for each of the services and update them when a new service comes online</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Negatives</strong> of having just one big cross-service topic-group
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s a lot of messages for each of the listeners to just wade through</li>
<li>I am going to need to create a Sage Orchestration Tracking number thingy so that listeners know that messages is meant form them, but I think i mite have to do that anyway cause one mite not get it or something and other Sagas mite mess up the order if done at that time</li>
<li>Separations of concerns seems to be broken with this cause down the line there is bound to be services that will never communicate. This mite also have security concerns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>_0729</em>
<em>Random thought:</em> I had I am going to need to figure out a global timeout time for services and messages cause I know I am going to have things trying to access data that will be in the Pending state so a retry will be needed cause I need to not link data to data that is in the pending state. So error handling will need to be done and the more I think about it that gets complex.</p>
