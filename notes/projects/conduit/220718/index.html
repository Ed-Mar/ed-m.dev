_0523</p><p>Okay I’ve been do throwing this idea around in my head after getting that reader to work last week. I don’t think I need a Kafka just to use cross service just to send REST request between services. After coming to this concussion. My first thought was damn I wasted a lot of time. Then I tried to rationalize it which I think won out in the end.</p><p>I learned to a small degree how Kafka works and how to integrate it with golang and the package go-kafka.

Kafka already has retry part and scalability built in, but is not really needed at the current state of things.
to get the best use of some of these features I would have to send all REST request through them and that just seems silly
I do think making the kafka reader and writer item could be useful later for items that don’t have a easily implementable REST requirement
I am still going to have to do the orchestration part of the pattern with sage it self and adding the kafka part right doesn’t seem to add anything of value. SO what I think I am trying to say is adding the kafka messaging between services doesn’t have a huge add at the current state if I am going to just send a REST request.
Now what…
I’m the in the middle of the writing the kafka write that and service can use do some basic test to see if works as expected then move on start on the saga pattern it self.</p><p>__
