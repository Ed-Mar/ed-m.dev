Even tho on the readme it seems to only support Kafka up to 2.6.1 and I am using Kafka with KRaft turned on in 3.2. Would appear Apache backward compatibility is working with at least this simple example.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/WmyrPrf.png alt="producer and consumer"></p><h2 id=i-have-some-idea-of-what-i-need-to-do>I have some idea of what I need to do</h2><p>I think I need to add add producer events and consumer events to the services that I have created. Each of the services will have the REST way for clients to send CRUD operations, then for inter-service communications between services they would use Kafka producer and consumer. I&rsquo;m not positive if need to replicate the CRUD operations for the events, but I know I will have to have at least approve/decline. So I think I will start with that for channels and servers. Then add CRUD event support as needed for now.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve found that having only these simple services it making it difficult to think about. When I look at more complex examples of this pattern with 4 or more services and many more transactions types it some how makes for sense for some reason. My services don&rsquo;t really do all that much which makes me think I&rsquo;m over thinking it idk.</p></div></div></div></body><footer><hr>Author <a href=https://ed-m.dev/about>Edward M- </a>| Framework <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></footer></html>
