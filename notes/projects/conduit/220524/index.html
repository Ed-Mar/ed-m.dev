<p>Alright I have moved to a warmer location and gotten set up</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a few months and I ready to get back into this.
One issue fresh install of the OS, I still have the code repo, but setting it back up will still be required not much but something. Also maybe some skill leakage(I forgot some stuff)</p>
<h3 id=databases>Databases</h3>
<p>So the sql setup code I had made this rather easy, but even with notes it apparels the roles for each of the service user need to pushed into the correct ownership roles for there tables.</p>

<p>Easy fix</p>
<p><img src=https://imgur.com/LF0kuh5.png alt="As the super user just alter the ownership of the table"></p>
<p>Not Really an issue, but I will need to try this again and get this automated some how. I will throw that on the list. Then add some test test for each of the services to confirm that it works before running. That can be done later once a CI pipeline has been made and an other item to add to the list.</p>
