(<a href=https://ed-m.dev>https://ed-m.dev</a>)</p><h3 id=work-progress>Work Progress</h3><p>Been learning and getting better and Hugo implementation and css/frontend.</p><ul><li>Got basic tags working</li><li>Summary on the homepage(mite need to tune this some more)</li><li>Added a subtitle Front matter parms to singles and partial to combine them</li><li>and probably some more things I forgot about.</li></ul><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/2D1JDfA.png alt="SC of  home page in current state"></p><h3 id=outstanding-issues-encounter>outstanding Issues encounter</h3><p>I am stuck on a few things right now.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t seem to get my preferred date format(YYMMDD_HHMM) to work cause I can&rsquo;t call int Month on the time function in go with in Hugo. This was a like 6 days ago, and I have know more about working with Hugo functions/variables</p><p>Local fonts are not working idk about that I assume Its just not getting and is simple</p><p>One I would like to change in the md->html rendering, but can&rsquo;t seem to find really how to do it. So let me see if can explain each block of text(so like a &ldquo;words words /n /n&rdquo; ) in the markdown file is rendered into a p html tag. I would prefer these be a div instead cause there tends be a better break between each of them. I&rsquo;m sure there should be a work around for this in css, but I can&rsquo;t figure it out; and I&rsquo;m far from being an css expert, just enough to be dangerous.
<img src=https://i.imgur.com/RZqaIJu.png alt="enter image description here"></p><p>I tired to take the {{.Content}} and replace it each of the each of the p tags and just add an br/ tag to the end of it. It did what I wanted, but when it piped to the page its in quotes which means it doesn&rsquo;t render into HTML. See screenshots below.</p><p><strong>Note instead of trying to insert a div or some other tag just increase the margin on the p tags.

Want to work on readability and it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right. Granted I kinda have the feeling for the most of the site, but the singles are the highest on that list.</li><li>Get the code highlighting for with the renderhook to not look shit.</li><li>Re organize the CSS. A lot of it is stepping on other classes styles and so on<ul><li>If can get break it down in separate files for better organization</li></ul></li><li>Get the local fonts to work I was looking at the time to DL the font in the chromium dev tools and it was like 75% of the load time. Granted still small but why not and limit dependencies.</li><li>Do the notes & projects _index.md and layouts.</li></ul><p>Then once I am complete with every and mostly happy with the site</p><ul><li>Move all the notes on my local machine over<ul><li>add all the necessary front matter and think hard over the tags good and hard maybe create a file in Data to keep info and better.</li></ul></li><li>Make it easy for me create my notes with some .profile for bash/zsh edits to add some shortcuts</li><li>Learn more about robot.txt and &lt; meta > to see if can get the site out and maybe have some else beside me read these, but either way</li><li>Figure out how I make so ppl can email me while fighting the bots from spamming</li><li>Get it on the Web for as cheap as possible</li></ul><p>I am sure I&rsquo;ll find some more items as they come to me.</p></div></div></div></body><footer><hr>Author <a href=https://ed-m.dev/about>Edward M- </a>| Framework <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></footer></html>
