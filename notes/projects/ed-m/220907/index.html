I have be posting my notes to a forum and think I should stop spamming there cause it seems like it&rsquo;s really not warranted or something I think I just like a place for these notes to live.</p><p>So what do I need a static site and keep it simple and cheap cause this something I plan doing for the rest of my most likely life.</p><p>I would like to try and make this using HUGO. which is just a simple CMS and web framework for generating static sites using markdown for the content. Which just seems to fit my needs rather nicely. I am sure there are some things that will not, but from what I can tell from 1000ft up it would appear to fit.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/kXFprof.png alt="HUGO logo"></p></div></div></div></body><footer><hr>Author <a href=https://ed-m.dev/about>Edward M- </a>| Framework <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></footer></html>
