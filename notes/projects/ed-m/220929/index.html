So I have come to one of the things I have been dreading, writing an about page. Due to I hate writing about my self or really even thinking about myself.</p><p>So I wanted to put relevant information on it about relevant.</p><p>Do I go full CV on it or leave it more sparse and open to inquiry</p><p>If I could put what I really like I would put large unemployed bald man looking to get railroaded by golang dev job.</p><p><em>_1419</em></p><p>That took longer than I thought it would even tho it was the most simple overall to do.</p><p>Heres a SC<img src=https://i.imgur.com/lon1Ek5.png alt="lil mobile test"></p><p>Think I going to swap out that the creepy photo I made of my self with Unicode Rook. Seems less like I am fucking wiredo, gotta that under the wraps kek.</p><h3 id=tags-page>Tags Page</h3><p><em>_1428</em></p><p>So I did a little work when I first implemented tags, but the page it self is trash.</p><p>Would like to break it down by project then tags. I think I can reuse some of the code I already have for that maybe, then under that just all the tags. I am not positive how often people really use tags. I use them more to understand what the content is about prior to reading not really searching for it. I guess that mite be a good thing to have sense I don&rsquo;t plan adding a search at his time.</p><p>Lego.</p></div></div></div></body><footer><hr>Author <a href=https://ed-m.dev/about>Edward M- </a>| Framework <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></footer></html>
